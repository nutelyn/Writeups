here you could find and read about HTB writeup both challenges and machines
also theres some random tools i developed for this scenario

list of tools:
1. addhost\
	addhost is a shell command to add hosts directly into your `/etc/hosts`\
	copy the file directly into `/usr/local/bin`, if it's not an executable then use `chmod +x addhost`\
	usage: `addhost ip dns`\
	ex: `addhost 12.34.56.78 some-domain.com`
