1. given 3 files `level4.flag.txt.enc`, `level4.hash.bin`, and `level4.py`
2. `nano level4.py` or `code level4.py` or `subl level4.py` or `vim level4.py` choose either one of these or the other than this but has an edit capabilities
3. notice that on the bottom-most part theres this line `pos_pw_list = ["6288", "6152", "4c7a", "b722", "9a6e", "6717", "4389", "1a28"...`
4. create a loop to crack the password and compare it with the `correct_pw_hash`
``` py
for i in pos_pw_list:
    hash = hash_pw(i)
    if hash == correct_pw_hash:
        print(f"Correct password is {i}")
```
5. the password is `973a`
6. `python level4.py`, enter the password
7. flag: `picoCTF{fl45h_5pr1ng1ng_ae0fb77c}`

note: the solution kinda feel like the same as PW Crack 3 for some reason
