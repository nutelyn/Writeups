1. given 3 files `level3.flag.txt.enc`, `level3.hash.bin`, and `level3.py`
2. `nano level3.py` or `code level3.py` or `subl level3.py` or `vim level3.py` choose either one of these or the other than this but has an edit capabilities
3. notice that on the bottom-most part theres this line `pos_pw_list = ["6997", "3ac8", "f0ac", "4b17", "ec27", "4e66", "865e"]`
4. create a loop to crack the password and compare it with the `correct_pw_hash`
``` py
for i in pos_pw_list:
    hash = hash_pw(i)
    if hash == correct_pw_hash:
        print(f"Correct password is {i}")
```
5. the password is `865e`
6. `python level3.py`, enter the password
7. flag: `picoCTF{m45h_fl1ng1ng_2b072a90}`
