1. given a connection command `nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342`
2. run the command in terminal, or alike
3. output a long line of ascii, save the output in another file ex. `netcat.txt`
4. open `python` or `python3` in terminal (syntax would be most likely the same)
``` py
>>> with open('netcat.txt') as f:
...     flag = ''.join([chr(int(i)) for i in f])
... # just pres enter here to break out of the with loop
>>> print(flag)
```
5. `flag: picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_5fb5e51d}`
