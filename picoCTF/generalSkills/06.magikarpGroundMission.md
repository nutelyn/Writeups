1. given a machine instance and an SSH credentials `ctf-player:481e7b14`
2. start the instance
3. given another command to login `ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 56272`, 
4. paste paste the command into terminal, `yes` if theres a prompt before SSH allows to connect, enter the password
5. when inside (notice that the terminal shows something like `ctf-player@pico-chall$`), run `ls`
6. there's a `1of3.flag.txt` file and a `instruction-to-2of3.txt`
7. `cat 1of3.flag.txt` save the content somewhere, and `cat instruction-to-2of3.txt` read the next instruction (go to root or `/`)
8. `cd /`, run `ls`, there's `2of3.flag.txt` and `instruction-to-3of3.txt` file
9. `cat 2of3.flag.txt` save the content somewhere, and `cat instruction-to-3of3.txt` read the next instruction (go to home or `~`)
10. `cd`, run `ls`, there's the last   `3of3.flag.txt`
11. `cat 3of3.flag.txt` save the content somewhere
12. concat all the flag part
13. flag: `picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_1118a9a4}`

Tips: use `pwd` if unsure about current working path
